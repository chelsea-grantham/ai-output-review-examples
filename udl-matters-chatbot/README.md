## Overview
UDL Matters is an AI chatbot I designed in PlayLab.ai to support K–12 teachers in creating and revising lesson and unit plans aligned to the **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** framework. The chatbot helps teachers anticipate barriers, provide multiple access points, and design flexible assessment options that support diverse learners.

The bot can:
- Generate new lesson plans aligned to UDL
- Create full multi-day unit plans
- Review and revise lesson plans teachers paste in
- Suggest accommodations, scaffolds, and enrichment extensions
- Offer multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression

## Why I Built This
Teachers are often expected to differentiate instruction for a wide range of learners *without the time, planning structures, or collaborative support needed to do it well*. UDL Matters is designed to lighten that cognitive load and make planning more equitable, flexible, and confidence-building for both teachers and students.
