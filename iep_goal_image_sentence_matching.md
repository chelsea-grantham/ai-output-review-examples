# IEP Goal-Aligned Worksheet Generation: Image + Sentence Matching

**Goal Addressed:**  
Given a choice of three sentences, the student will independently and correctly identify a 5–7 word sentence that accurately describes an image.

**Student Interests Integrated:**  
Unicorns, mermaids, princesses, and Disney characters  
(used to increase engagement, motivation, and time-on-task)

## Initial Prompt Used
"You are a special education teacher. Create 20 worksheets with images involving: unicorns, mermaids, princesses and Disney characters, that will allow a student to practice the following IEP goal: Given a choice of three sentences, student will independently and correctly identify a five to seven word sentence that accurately describes an image."

---

## Initial AI Output (Before Refinement)

The initial output included:
- Sentences that were **too long** (8–12 words)
- Vocabulary that was above the student’s reading level
- Images that did not clearly match any sentence
- Distractor sentences that were either **too similar** or **too silly**
- Tone that sometimes became narrative instead of descriptive

This made the materials **instructionally imprecise** and **hard for the student to use independently**.

---

## Issues Identified
| Category | Needed Adjustment | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Sentence Length | Must be 5–7 words | Matches the IEP target skill |
| Reading Level | Should be ~2nd–3rd grade | Ensures independent practice |
| Image Clarity | Image must have one obvious “correct” statement | Reduces frustration and ambiguity |
| Distractors | Should be realistic but clearly incorrect | Encourages discrimination, not guessing |
| Tone | Needs to be neutral + descriptive | Prevents confusion and cognitive overload |

---

## Prompt Refinement Applied
Create 10 practice items.
For each item:

Choose a simple, clearly recognizable image of a unicorn, mermaid, princess, or Disney character (cute / illustrated, not abstract).

Provide three sentence options.

Each sentence must be 5–7 words long.

Only one sentence should accurately describe the image.

Distractor sentences should be realistic but clearly incorrect.

Use vocabulary at a 2nd–3rd grade reading level.

Use neutral descriptive language, not narrative or emotional language.

## Final Example (Human-Refined Version)

**Image:** Cute illustrated mermaid sitting on a rock and waving  
*(Public Domain Image: https://publicdomainvectors.org/en/free-clipart/Mermaid-waving/81706.html)*

**Sentence Options:**
1. The mermaid is sitting and waving. ✅  
2. The mermaid is flying in space.  
3. The mermaid is eating three sandwiches.

**Why This Works:**
- Sentence length = 6 words (IEP-aligned)
- Visual match is **clear and concrete**
- Distractors are plausible but obviously incorrect
- Tone is calm, simple, and descriptive
- The student can succeed **independently**, which supports confidence + carryover

## Additional Example

**Image:** Cute illustrated unicorn standing in grass  
*(Public Domain Image: https://openclipart.org/detail/305186/cute-unicorn)*

**Sentence Options:**
1. The unicorn is standing in grass. ✅  
2. The unicorn is driving a car.  
3. The unicorn is under the ocean.

## Extended Description (For Recruiters / Reviewers)

This example demonstrates how I use AI as a **drafting tool**, and then apply human judgment to make sure the output is instructionally meaningful, developmentally appropriate, and aligned to specific IEP goals. 

The refinement process required:
- Setting clear constraints
- Evaluating clarity and distractor logic
- Adjusting reading level and sentence structure
- Ensuring the student could complete the task independently

This reflects **human-in-the-loop quality assurance**, prompt iteration, and thoughtful alignment to real learner needs — all core skills in LLM quality work.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Human-in-the-loop review and refinement
- Structured prompt iteration with clear criteria
- Task design aligned to measurable learning goals
- Reading level + cognitive load adjustment
- Attention to precision, clarity, and student independence
