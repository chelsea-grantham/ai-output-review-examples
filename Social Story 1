## Social Story: Staying Calm and Doing My Best in Art Class

### Purpose
This social story supports a student who becomes frustrated when their artwork does not match their internal expectation. The goal is to provide emotional validation, support self-regulation, and reframe art class as a space for growth and enjoyment—not perfection.

### Initial AI-Generated Output (Before Refinement)
"When I am in art class, I need to stay calm and try my best. I should not yell or get upset if my art does not look the way I want. I need to listen to the teacher and follow the rules. Art is supposed to be fun, so I should stay positive and not get frustrated."

---

### Issues Identified
- **Tone was corrective rather than supportive**
- No acknowledgment that frustration is a real, valid emotion
- Focused on **behavior compliance** instead of coping strategies
- Did not center the student’s voice or experience
- Missing a sense of **growth, agency, and self-compassion**

### Final Revised Social Story (Human-Refined Output)
I am Alex. I love art class! Art is a time when I can be creative and use my imagination. I get to paint, draw, and make cool projects.

Sometimes, I want my art to be perfect. I like everything to look just right. When it doesn't turn out how I want, I can feel upset. I might yell or get frustrated.

It’s okay to feel this way. Many kids feel this way sometimes. I can remember that making art is about having fun, not just being perfect. I can take a deep breath and try again.

When I feel frustrated, I can do a few things:  
1. **Take a Break:** If I need a moment, I can ask my teacher for a short break to calm down.  
2. **Ask for Help:** If I am stuck or don’t like what I made, I can ask my teacher or a friend. They want to support me.  
3. **Focus on the Fun:** I can think about what I like about the project and how much fun it is to create.

I will remember that it's great to try my best and that mistakes can be a part of learning. Each time I create something new, I get better!

I can feel proud of my artwork, even if it’s not perfect. Making art is about expressing myself and enjoying the process. I will keep trying, and it’s okay if things don’t go my way right away.

Art class is a fun place where I can relax, be creative, and learn. I can do this!
