## **Initial AI Output (Before Refinement)**

"When I am in art class, I need to stay calm and try my best. I should not yell or get upset if my art does not look the way I want. I need to listen to the teacher and follow the rules. Art is supposed to be fun, so I should stay positive and not get frustrated."

## **Issues Identified**
- Tone was **corrective** rather than **supportive**
- No acknowledgment that frustration is a **real, valid emotion**
- Focused on **compliance**, not coping
- Did not **center the student’s voice**

## **Final Social Story (Human-Refined Version)**

**Staying Calm and Doing My Best in Art Class**

I am ________________________. I love art class! Art is a time when I can be creative and use my imagination. I get to paint, draw, and make cool projects.

Sometimes, I want my art to be perfect. I like everything to look just right. When it doesn’t turn out how I want, I can feel upset. I might yell or get frustrated.

It’s okay to feel this way. Many kids feel this way sometimes. I can remember that making art is about having fun, not just being perfect. I can take a deep breath and try again.

When I feel frustrated, I can do a few things:

**1. Take a Break:**  
I can ask my teacher if I can take a short break to calm down.

**2. Ask for Help:**  
If I don’t like what I made or feel stuck, I can ask my teacher or a friend. They want to help me.

**3. Focus on the Fun:**  
I can think about what I like about the art project and how fun it is to create.

I will remember that trying my best is what matters. Mistakes can be a part of learning. Each time I create something new, I get better!

I can feel proud of my artwork, even if it isn’t perfect. Art is about expressing myself and enjoying the process. I can do this!
